This repo is consisted of a [frontend](./frontend/), which is a RainbowKit + wagmi + Next.js project, and a [backend](./backend/), which is a Hardhat project. This product basically allows users to purchase different types of insurance plans like Travel Insurance, and claim automatically in ETH in case there is an unfortunate incident.
